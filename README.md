# Responsive-Portfolio

In this folder you'll find 3 files that were made using Bootstrap and CSS 

the contact section has a form that is taken straight from the get bootstrap website 

Also, using the bootstrap grid system, these files were built with containers rows and columns 

Attached to each of the pages would be an internal css file that styles each site with a similar header, navbar, and footer
